# Exercise 7
  *   IntStream -->  This is the int primitive specialization of Stream.
  *   rangeClosed​(int startInclusive, int endInclusive) --> Returns a sequential ordered IntStream from startInclusive (inclusive) to endInclusive (inclusive) by an incremental step of 1
  *   filter​(IntPredicate predicate)  -->  Returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate.
  *   mapToObj​(IntFunction<? extends U> mapper) -->  Returns an object-valued Stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.
  *   collect​(Collector<? super T,​A,​R> collector) --> Performs a mutable reduction operation on the elements of this stream using a Collector.
  *   joining​(CharSequence delimiter)   ->   Returns a Collector that concatenates the input elements, separated by the specified delimiter, in encounter order
